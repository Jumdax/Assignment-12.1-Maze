# About: 
 
 <p>During the development of this project, I accomplished the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Created the scene using prefabs from the SNAPS Prototype Pack.</li>
  <li>Set up VR interactions by creating the XR origin.</li>
  <li>Implemented Raycast interactions with the controllers.</li>
  <li>Defined interactors and interactables for seamless interactions.</li>
  <li>Created teleportation areas using a locomotion system for easy navigation with the left hand.</li>
  <li>Ensured alignment of walls, floors and environment by utilizing Progrids.</li>
  <li>Enabled snap turns using the controllers for both hands.</li>
  <li>Utilized layer masks to determine which interactors can interact with specific interactables  </li>
  <li>Designed and created a Key using probuilder.</li>
  <li>Implemented a grab interaction for the right hand using XR Direct Interaction to pick up the key.</li>
</ul>
